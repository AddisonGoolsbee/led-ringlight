Hey there, looks like you found my humble little scam      (oh crap!)
Hear me out here, the fact that I wrote a CLI to automate commit generation is pretty cool
Admit it, you're impressed
Aaaaand, if anything, this tool is MORE impressive than seeing a bunch of commits for whatever project this is
Also, I do want to mention, most of my commits (like more than 90%) are NOT from this script
You know, they say a good programmer is a lazy programmer, so really, I'm the best programmer
Also this may or may not be the reason my GitHub profile says "Fact: I am the best coder"

Man, I keep worrying, NOT putting any message here would be REALLY bad, but at the same time having a message means I'm more likely to be found out...
Hey! I have an idea, if you're reading this, shoot me an email or something, I'd like to know if anyone will actually find out
